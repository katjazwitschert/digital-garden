# About my Digital Garden
This is my digital garden.

I stumbled across this concept a few years ago. Most recently, I had discovered a digital garden community on Twitter. And then I read about Johannes Kleske's digital garden in his newsletter. And that's what I'm trying out now.

For starters, I'm writing #deutsch and #english because I can't decide which language will work better for me. All key pages are therefore bilingual. But it can also happen that there is no translation for some content. https://deepl.com is your friend in these cases.

I built this digital garden with a free, open-source template which is [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

I simply followed this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) – and it worked really well.
